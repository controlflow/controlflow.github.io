My name is Aleksandr Shvedov, I'm a .NET developer currently residing in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This is my small blog about programming. Here, I reflect on the design of programming languages, IDE tools and compilers, runtime environments, and type systems.

Since year 2011 I have been working at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) on the IDE tooling for .NET languages ([ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper) and [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider) IDE). At JetBrains I lead the team of talanted engeneers focused on IDE language support for managed languages (C#, VB.NET, F#) and other core IDE experiences (code analysis, code refactorings, code completion, etc).
